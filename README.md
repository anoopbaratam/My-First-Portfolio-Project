# My-First-Portfolio-Project
This one right here is going to be my first static portfolio website, completely designed and implemented by myself using the web languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There are some other technologies I have used here namely Sass which is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets and Bootstrap framework which allows us to embed the pre-built components and utilities in the project. Although few parts of the website were inspired from random sources across the internet, the code underlying is hardcoded completely by me rather copy-paste. I also modified some prebuilt components to get the entire website an even look. Although media queries were used to make the website responsive, advanced concepts like flexbox, css grid were are also used to make the website responsive and also as a token of practice. For now this is going to remain as a sample website and this will be updated or might be replaced with a completely new design with the time to come.
